# DH140FinalProject

### Project Ideas & Class Objective 

Being a Human Bio & Society major I'm interested in all things health and wellness. One of the things that originally drew me to digital humanities was the way in which big data and health interact – this is especially relevant in the realm of digital health which I hope to explore more. In terms of bringing this data into a humanities context, I'm open to topics related to health equity and disease distribution among diverse groups. I'm also hoping to frame my research in a global context, using data from various countries and contexts to unlock truths regarding disease distribution. 

After having looked into a few different data sets I'm potentially interested in looking at global indicators of reproductive health, this would look like variables relating to maternal mortality, morbidity and child health indicators.
