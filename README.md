### Project Ideas & Class Objective 

Being a Human Bio & Society major I'm interested in all things health and wellness. One of the things that originally drew me to digital humanities was the way in which big data and health interact – this is especially relevant in the realm of digital health which I hope to explore more. In terms of bringing this data into a humanities context, I'm open to topics related to health equity and disease distribution among diverse groups. I'm also hoping to frame my research in a global context, using data from various countries and contexts to unlock truths regarding disease distribution. 

### Assignment #1

In our first assignment I looked at the following datasets:

| Dataset Name  | Description  | Link  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Drug Consumption Dataset     | I think this dataset could be interesting when looking at the social determinants of health and addiction | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29#|
| Influenza Outbreak Event Prediction via Twitter Dataset| I'd be curious to see how Twitter data could be used to predict flu outbreak      |   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Influenza+outbreak+event+prediction+via+Twitter+data |
| Deaths in US Jails Dataset | I'd love to look at 'deaths while incarcerated' as a public health issue   |    https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/|

### Current project thinking

After having looked into a few different data sets I'm potentially interested in looking at global indicators of reproductive health, this would look like variables relating to maternal mortality, morbidity and child health indicators. My specific interest in this subject also came to me in another class I'm taking this quarter: Child and Maternal Health – I'd love to essentially 'mix' these two subjects by finding dataset(s) that work with this subject matter.
