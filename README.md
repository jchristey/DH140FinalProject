### Project Ideas & Class Objective 

Being a Human Bio & Society major I'm interested in all things health and wellness. One of the things that originally drew me to digital humanities was the way in which big data and health interact – this is especially relevant in the realm of digital health which I hope to explore more. In terms of bringing this data into a humanities context, I'm open to topics related to health equity and disease distribution among diverse groups. I'm also hoping to frame my research in a global context, using data from various countries and contexts to unlock truths regarding disease distribution. 

### Topic and Questions

Maternal mortality is an important factor of reproductive health that is sometimes overlooked but vital in terms of the health and wellness of family structures as a whole, and potentially telling of overarching trends from region to region as rates of maternal mortality change. By having a more in-depth knowledge of where this is being observed most and what factors usually accompany higher rates of maternal mortality, global and local governments can better reassign resources to address higher rates of it, in order to increase reproductive health everywhere and promote reproductive justice. 

##### This being said here are some of the questions being considered for this analysis:

*How have global trends of maternal mortality changed over time? 

What are these changes due to (some of the data to be used will be whether or not a medical personnel were present, and income level of countries)?*
